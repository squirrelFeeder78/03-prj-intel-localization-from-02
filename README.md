# Project 2: Intel Sustainability Journey

Launch a Codespace to get started! Remember to Commit and Push your project changes to GitHub from Codespaces to prevent losing progress.


# Project 3: Intel Site Localization - Adapting Your Website for RTL Languages
You'll adapt your Intel Journey webpage to support right-to-left (RTL) languages and improve its accessibility and interactivity.

You'll modify the layout, integrate Bootstrap, and add a subscription form to enhance user engagement.
